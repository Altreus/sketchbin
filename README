Sketchbin v0.00.0001_3

Sketchbin is like pastebin except you draw pictures instead of pasting code.

Clone and run

  node server.js

then point your browser to localhost:3000

Currently only the line tool works by any measure. Click on "Line" to use it.

BUGS and TODO:

The canvas itself has all the listeners for events on it. This means that many
events are not fired while actually drawing. This means drawing wide lines is
jerky; it also means you can't start a line while pointing at another line.

I think I know how to deal with them :)

Everything else is a todo, including a select tool.
